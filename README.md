# ml-flight-delay-cancellation-prediction
Description: Machine Learning project for predicting flight delays and cancellations using historical flight data. The repository includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation with multiple ML algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression). The goal is to build predictive models .
